*TikTok Liked Videos Transcription Self-Portrait*
This project is a self-portrait created from the transcriptions of my favorite TikTok videos. The transcriptions are displayed in the format of an online newspaper, creating a unique and creative representation of my digital self.

/How It Works/
To create this self-portrait, I went through my liked videos on TikTok and transcribed them into text files. Each text file contains the transcript of a single video, along with the video's title and a link to the original TikTok. I then used a script to convert the text files into HTML files in the format of an online newspaper.

The HTML files include a header with the name of the newspaper, a section for the newspaper's image, and multiple sections containing the video titles and transcriptions. Each section has a title and a block of text, creating the appearance of articles in a newspaper.

/Technologies Used/
This project uses the following technologies:

Python: Used to convert the text files to HTML files.
HTML/CSS: Used to create the online newspaper format.
GitHub Pages: Used to host the online newspaper and make it accessible to others.
